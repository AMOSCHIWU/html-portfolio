                <p><span class="special-text">Taipei 101 </span>is one of the most iconic landmarks in Taiwan, located in the Xinyi District of Taipei. Completed in 2004, it was once the tallest building in the world, standing at a height of 508 meters. Taipei 101 is renowned for its unique design, which combines modern architecture with traditional Asian elements. The skyscraper houses offices, retail spaces, and an observation deck offering breathtaking views of the city. It also features a massive tuned mass damper, which helps stabilize the building against strong winds and earthquakes. Taipei 101 is not only a symbol of Taiwan's economic growth but also a must-visit destination for tourists from around the globe.</p>

                <p><span class="special-text">Guishan Island</span>, also known as Turtle Island, is a small volcanic island off the coast of Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan. Named for its unique turtle-like shape, the island is a popular destination known for its rugged landscapes, volcanic hot springs, and diverse marine life. Guishan Island is a protected area, and access is limited to preserve its natural beauty and ecosystem. Visitors can take guided boat tours around the island to enjoy scenic views, observe dolphins and whales, and even witness volcanic steam vents in action. This iconic island holds cultural significance as well, with ancient legends linking it to Taiwanese folklore and myths.</p>

                <p><span class="special-text">The Tao</span>, also known as the Yami, are an Indigenous group native to Lanyu (Orchid Island), located off the southeastern coast of Taiwan. With a population of about 4,000, the Tao are distinct from other Taiwanese Indigenous groups, sharing cultural and linguistic roots with the Batanes Islands in the Philippines. The Tao people are renowned for their seafaring traditions and their unique craftsmanship in building "tatala" fishing boats, beautifully decorated and symbolizing both artistic skill and cultural heritage. 
                    Fishing, especially flying fish, is central to Tao life, and the Tao observe seasonal customs that honor the cycles of fishing and agriculture. Their spiritual beliefs are closely tied to nature, with reverence for the ocean and respect for ancestral spirits. 
                    The Tao continue to uphold their traditions in the face of modern challenges, and their culture remains an essential part of Taiwan's diverse cultural landscape.</p>
